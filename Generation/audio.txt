Dijkstra algorithm is like a magical map that helps us find the shortest path from one place to another. Imagine you have a big maze, and you want to reach a delicious ice cream at the end. The algorithm helps you choose the best path by checking how far each path is and picking the shortest one. It keeps doing this until you reach the ice cream. So, it's like having a smart guide who always knows where to go to get the ice cream quickly!
