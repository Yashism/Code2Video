1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,026
Supply and demand are like an invisible tug of war that happens whenever we want to buy something

2
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:08,377
Imagine you're at a carnival and there's a stall with a single

3
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:09,773
super cool superhero toy left

4
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:10,611
Lots of children

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,007
like you and your friends

6
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:12,844
would want it

7
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:14,240
right? This is high demand

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,916
But since there's only one toy

9
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,033
it's a limited supply

10
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:22,338
so this tug of war between wanting the toy and having only one makes it more special and sometimes

11
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:23,176
more pricey! Now

12
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:25,689
say there are lots and lots of superhero toys

13
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:26,247
scattered everywhere

14
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:28,481
You can simply pick one whenever you want

15
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,598
This is high supply

16
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:31,832
But because it's so easy to get one

17
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,903
maybe you and your friends don't want a toy that badly

18
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,020
This is low demand

19
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,299
So

20
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,975
when there are too many toys

21
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,650
but not enough kids wanting them

22
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,280
these toys may become cheaper! This amazing invisible game of tug of war

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,027
where too much or too little can change how much something costs or how special it is

24
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,981
is what we call supply and demand

25
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:53,890
Like how toys at the carnival can become more or less expensive or popular

26
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,241
supply and demand shape the prices of all things in our world

27
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,358
from candies to houses!
