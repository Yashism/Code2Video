1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,173
Imagine you're playing with your toy cars

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,153
and you made a long

3
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:13,711
straight road with your building blocks where your cars will race

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:22,056
But let's say you only have a small magnifying glass to look at them

5
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:29,209
so you can only see a few of your cars at once

6
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:33,978
Think of this magnifying glass as a "window"

7
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:45,304
that you slide along the straight road (the "array" or "list") to view different sets of cars (or "subarrays")

8
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:50,669
This is what we call the sliding window concept

9
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,054
In computing and mathematics

10
00:00:53,054 --> 00:01:04,380
it's a way of looking at a larger problem - like the whole row of cars - in smaller

11
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:13,322
more manageable chunks - like the few cars you can see through your magnifying glass

12
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:21,071
You move the window from one end of the row to the other

13
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:25,840
while keeping the size of the window constant

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,801
meaning you're always looking at the same number of cars

15
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:37,166
just different ones as you move along the road

16
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:43,127
Want to know which of your cars are the fastest

17
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:58,626
or how many red cars are in your collection? The sliding window can help to figure this out by examining all the cars in a simplified

18
00:01:58,626 --> 00:01:59,818
orderly way

19
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:06,971
Itâ€™s like a pair of roving eyes moving across your car race!
