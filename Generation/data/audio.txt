Supply and demand are like an invisible tug of war that happens whenever we want to buy something. Imagine you're at a carnival and there's a stall with a single, super cool superhero toy left. Lots of children, like you and your friends, would want it, right? This is high demand. But since there's only one toy, it's a limited supply, so this tug of war between wanting the toy and having only one makes it more special and sometimes, more pricey! Now, say there are lots and lots of superhero toys, scattered everywhere. You can simply pick one whenever you want. This is high supply. But because it's so easy to get one, maybe you and your friends don't want a toy that badly. This is low demand. So, when there are too many toys, but not enough kids wanting them, these toys may become cheaper! This amazing invisible game of tug of war, where too much or too little can change how much something costs or how special it is, is what we call supply and demand. Like how toys at the carnival can become more or less expensive or popular, supply and demand shape the prices of all things in our world, from candies to houses!
