Imagine if you have a toy box full of your favorite toys. Each toy has a name and a specific place in the box. Now, instead of telling someone every detail about your toy, what if you could just give them a little card that tells them exactly where to find the toy in the box? That is what a pointer does in computer programming. It holds an address, or a location of something instead of the actual value. Just like your toy box, your computer has a box too, it's called memory. Inside this memory box, there are many slots where your computer stores all kinds of information. Now every time your computer wants to find specific information, instead of looking everywhere, it would just look at the pointer, or the address card, to know exactly where that piece of information is stored. This makes the computer's job a lot easier and quicker. So basically, a pointer points the way to the memory location where a value is stored, just like your toy card points the way to the toy in the box. Pretty cool right, gigantic computers using the same method as you to find their toys in their huge toy box!
